_The purpose of this blog is to analyze outcomes in the prior week's Draftkings millionaire maker contest and, instead of reviewing the winning $1M lineup, retroactively build a lineup that could have taken down the tournament_.  
 
_This exercise helps show the value of zigging where others zag in large field GPPs, but also illustrates that you don't need to go way off the board to build a lineup capable of outscoring 200K+ entries.  Yes it's easy to play Monday morning quarterback, but there are logical ex ante reasons for rostering the following lineup and each player or game stack should have been on the radar of DK millionaire maker contestants entering multiple lineups_.

In week 8 the winning team rostered by LololoLola (he or she probably had some laughs last Sunday) scored 242.8 points, therefore we need 242.81 points to win.  Let's see how we could have gotten there. 

## RB1, RB2 and Flex

Week 8 presented a lot of depth and value at the running back position with several viable plays in the $5K range, great matchups for talented backs in the low $7K range, and Todd Gurley under five figures.  Many contestants likely started their rosters by locking 3 RBs, beginning with one or more of the trio of James Conner, Kareem Hunt and Joe Mixon.  Conner's role felt the most solid of these three as Conner was coming off back to back games of 19+ carries, 4 receptions, and two TDs. In a great matchup at home against the Browns, Conner was a chalky play with a high floor and ceiling. 

Parallel to the $7K tier, there was a trio of backs in the $5K range that was popular heading into Sunday due to recent role changes and strong performances: Kerryon Johnson, Phillip Lindsay and Marlon Mack. Finding reliable value at the wide receiver position felt more challenging than at RB in week 8 so there was merit to saving salary and rostering two of these guys while omitting Gurley. Kerryon Johnson has undeniable talent but hasn't gotten looks at the goal line which has limited some of his upside. UDFA Phillip Lindsay has been a surprising bright spot on the Denver Offense, and with Royce Freeman out he was in a good position to get additional red zone touches in a potentially high scoring game with the Chiefs. Lastly, we have Mack who logically would be the least popular of the three given his injury designation during the week.  Mack was just off a 30+ pt game and back to back games with 6.5+ yards per carry, demonstrating his high ceiling. Against a dreadful Raiders team Mack was a sharp play at lower projected ownership. 

### Selections

| Position | Player      |  Salary |
|----------|-------------|--------:|
| RB1 |  James Conner    | $7500 |
| RB2 |  Phillip Lindsay | $5200 |
| FLEX | Marlon Mack     | $5400 |

## Game Stack - QB, WR1, WR2 and TE  

One of the best games on the slate to target pass catchers and QBs was Tampa at Cincinatti.  Tampa's soft pass defense started the year allowing 300+ passing yards in the first six weeks of the season, only breaking the streak in week 7 against a struggling (yet popular in DFS circles!) Browns offense.  QBs likely have no higher of a ceiling than in a home matchup against the Bucs (see [Trubisky, Mitchell][mitch-trubisky]) so Andy Dalton was a reasonable play at $6200.  On the other side of this game Jameis Winston projected to be productive, with the Tampa offense heavily relying on the pass to move the ball (364 avg. passing yards per game). Winston ended up being the more popular choice with contestants in the Milly Maker over Dalton (11.7% vs. 7.8%). I preferred Jameis as well, but Sunday's outcome really was no surprise given Winston's often erratic play.  If creating multiple lineups, there certainly was merit to taking shots on both QBs in what was likely to be a shootout given the game script we've seen repeatedly with this Tampa team.

As for pass catchers, there were a lot of great choices in this game.  The pool of available pass catchers in this game
included:

- AJ Green $8000
- Mike Evans $7700
- Tyler Boyd $6700
- Desean Jackson $5300
- Chris Godwin $4500
- OJ Howard $3900
- CJ Uzomah $3500

Green, Evans, Boyd and Jackson have all shown off 30+ point ceiling this year, so all four were firmly in play.  Both Howard and Uzomah projected to be popular plays in week 8 as the TE position was a bit thin, however Howard is the more talented player and had been separating himself from Cameron Brate after getting 9 targets in week 7.  By rostering Boyd over Green we save some salary and can more comfortably fit in Evans, the pass catcher on the Bucs most likely to hit 30+ points. In addition, if Green doesn't pay off salary we have a similarly priced pivot in Evans which will add separation from other Dalton lineups in the field.

### Selections

| Position | Player      |  Salary |
|----------|-------------|--------:|
| QB |  Andy Dalton    | $6200 |
| WR1 |  Mike Evans | $7800 |
| WR2 | Tyler Boyd     | $6700 |
| TE  | OJ Howard      | $3900 |

## WR3 and Defense

The clear chalk play at Defense was Pittsburgh at $2300 home against Cleveland.  On 34.2% of rosters, the Steelers predictably were the most popular DST selected in the milly maker by a huge margin (the Bears were next closest at 8.4%).  While it was so easy to plug in the Steelers at near minimum salary, doing so effectively cancels out any leverage you may get at the DST postion. In other words, even if the Steelers D goes off we won't climb up the leaderboard.  Because DST outcomes are so volatile, pivoting to another defense in a good matchup was a clever way to differentiate a lineup in a massive tournament. One such team in a good matchup was Washington at $2700 against the woeful NY Giants.  Anyone following the NFL this season has likely heard about the Giants underachieving offense and Eli's poor play.  Their weaknesses start up front, so even if Odell/Saquon had productive days, Washington was likely to get sacks and potentially force Eli to turn it over.  

This leaves us with $4600 remaining for the final WR slot. 23% of milly maker rosters had a WR in the $4400 - $4600 range, however the choice contestants made in this spot ended up making or breaking their lineups.  The receivers in this range included:

- Sammy Watkins $4600
- Marquez Valdes-Scantling $4600
- Christian Kirk $4500
- Chris Godwin $4500
- Larry Fitzgerald $4400

Of these options Sammy Watkins in retrospect stands out as the WR with the highest upside. Watkins has 9 games of DK point totals over 25 points in his career (out of 59 total games) and is playing in the most electric passing attack in the NFL.  Godwin was the most popular choice in this range, likely plugged in frequently in Jameis Winston stacks. But given the value at RB and the better pass catchers available in that game (as covered in the game stack section) we didn't need to reach for a player like Godwin who has 1 career game of 20+ Draftkings points.  The figure below shows how ownership shook out for WR in this range.  Those that got on Watkins or Fitzgerald had the potential for big scores.

## Results

Our "If only..." team this week ended up with a point total of 243.5 points, narrowly edging out the week 8 winner.  Obviously this was not the perfect lineup in week 8. Paying up to Mahomes or getting on future hall of famers in good matchups (Adrian Peterson and Larry Fitzgerald) could have gotten us on a different lineup construction with a higher point total.  However the purpose of this analysis is to focus on evaluating strategies that can lead to a million dollar lineup.  Finding RB value, stacking a likely pass-friendly game, pivoting at DST and plugging in a high upside mid-range WR was one path to success last week.  

| Position | Player      |  Salary | Pts| Own %|
|----------|-------------|--------:|----:|-----:|
| QB |  Andy Dalton    | $6200 | 20.2 | 7.79% |
| RB1 |  James Conner    | $7500 | 41.2 | 32.50% |
| RB2 |  Phillip Lindsay | $5200 | 20.2 | 30.43% |
| WR1 |  Mike Evans | $7800 | 32.9 | 7.28% |
| WR2 | Tyler Boyd     | $6700 | 31.6 | 14.99% |
| WR3 |  Sammy Watkins    | $4600 | 33.7 | 5.09% |
| TE  | OJ Howard      | $3900 | 16.8 | 19.89% |
| FLEX | Marlon Mack     | $5400 | 31.9 | 8.54% |
| DST |  Washington | $2700 | 15.0 | 7.0% |
|     | Total       | $50000 | 243.5 | |

Looking ahead to week 9 we have another opportunity on the main slate to target the Tampa pass defense with Cam Newton and the Panthers.  In addition, the Rams Saints game with a 60 point over/under looks to be one to target RBs and pass catchers. We will see a much different distribution of ownership at defense as it is hard to fit in the Bears against the pick-six king Nathan Peterman and no clear cut value like the Steelers.  I feel like roster construction will be a bit different this week with Gurley likely to be more popular, more contestants paying up at TE to Kelce and reaching for value at WR with players like Courtland Sutton, Tre'Quan Smith and DJ Moore. Finding the right WR value play (like Watkins last week) will likely be the difference-maker in week 9.
