_The purpose of this blog is to analyze outcomes in the prior week's Draftkings millionaire maker contest and, instead of reviewing the winning $1M lineup, retroactively build a lineup that could have taken down the tournament_.  
 
_This exercise helps show the value of zigging where others zag in large field GPPs, but also illustrates that you don't need to go way off the board to build a lineup capable of outscoring 200K+ entries.  Yes it's easy to play Monday morning quarterback, but there are logical ex ante reasons for rostering the following lineup and each player or game stack should have been on the radar of DK millionaire maker contestants entering multiple lineups_.

Week 9 was a high scoring week in fantasy-friendly NFL matchups, but interestingly Millionaire Maker scores were on par with the prior week.  The week 9 million dollar lineup rostered by jab76r scored 245.42 points, therefore we need 245.43 points to win.  Let's see how we could have gotten there. 

## Game Stack 1: QB, RB1, WR1, WR2

The week 9 main slate was highlighted by two games with high team totals: Rams at Saints and Tampa at Carolina. The Rams and Saints matchup boasted a nearly 60 point total and we discussed last week how game scripts in matchups with Tampa tend to skew pass-heavy. The secret was definitely out about Tampa's attackable defense as Cam Newton was the most popular QB on the slate.  However New Orleans has been equally weak against opposing QBs and receivers.  The plot below shows combined QB and WR Draftkings points against both teams. New Orleans had allowed more combined points to the positions in 5 weeks.

With the high total, great matchup and talented corp of Rams wideouts, Goff was a solid play.  Cooper Kupp was the hyped receiver going into week 9 (he ended up the most popular WR on the slate), but Brandin Cooks represented a good pivot in a return to the Superdome.  On the other side of the ball Kamara and Thomas were the Saints' best weapons to move the ball.  Surprisingly their price came at a discount (just under $15,000 compared to $18,700 in week 4) which made this stack even easier to plug in.  

### Selections

| Position | Player      |  Salary |
|----------|-------------|--------:|
| WB  |  Jared Goff      | $6000 |
| RB1 |  Alvin Kamara    | $7300 |
| WR1 |  Michael Thomas  | $7600 |
| WR2 |  Brandin Cooks   | $6700 |

## Game Stack 2 - RB2, WR3, TE 

While a lot of attention in the DFS world was paid to the two matchups discussed in the prior section, the Chiefs offense was also a popular target in the Millionaire Maker.  Patrick Mahomes is still the front-runner in the MVP race and has topped 300 yards in every game since week one.  Mahomes spreads the wealth in their offense but getting exposure to the Chiefs passing attack always has merit.  Travis Kelce was the most expensive TE on the slate, however he was a relatively affordable way to get a reliable piece of the Chiefs offense as he was cheaper than Mahomes, Hunt, and Hill. The same can be said for Sammy Watkins who was fresh off a 30+ point performance yet still priced below $5K.  

On the other side of this game was a Browns offense in transition following coaching changes.  If we were to cash in on a high-scoring Chiefs performance, the Browns feasibly would need to rely more on the pass to keep pace.  Rostering Duke Johnson throughout the season had generally been a losing proposition going into week 9 as he had scored less than 6 points in six of eight games.  But in the two games in which he had scored double digit points this season, Cleveland allowed 38+ points.  If we were expecting an offensive explosion for the Chiefs, we could reasonably expect more volume for Duke. We also knew Nick Chubb would be a relatively popular budget RB choice (he ended up on 21% of rosters), so a successful week for Duke would likely come at Chubb's expense. 

Clicking on Johnson was a leap of faith following the departure of Hue Jackson and Todd Haley and a favorable game script.  However in order for our lineup to post an exeptional score, we need to hit on these types of high-upside correlation plays.  We could have also employed a similar game stack by playing Kareem Hunt and Duke Johnson.

### Selections

| Position | Player      |  Salary |
|----------|-------------|--------:|
| RB2 |  Duke Johnson   | $3800|
| WR3 |  Sammy Watkins  | $4900 |
| TE  |  Travis Kelce   | $6600 |

## FLEX and Defense

There was a lot of perceived value at the WR position in week 9 following some recent trades and injuries that suggested role changes.  Three that stood out were Saints WR Tre'Quan Smith, Carolina WR DJ Moore and Denver WR Courtland Sutton.  Each of these young talented pass catchers carries big upside but also a low floor.  To potentially gain leverage on the field, one approach to the flex position was to fade all of these similarly-priced WR and instead plug in a popular alternative at a different position. In this case it was TE O.J. Howard at $4300.  Howard was in our "If only..." lineup in week 8 given his talent and increasing role in the pass-heavy Tampa offense.  Carolina also has been leaky against tight ends this year giving Howard some extra upside in a good matchup.

For defense, we have $2800 left over which leaves a good option in Miami against the turn-over prone Sam Darnold and the Jets.  No need to over-think this one. 

### Selections

| Position | Player      |  Salary |
|----------|-------------|--------:|
| FLEX |  O.J. Howard    | $4300 |
| DST |  Miami | $2800 |

## Results

Our "If only..." team this week ended up with a point total of 251.64 points, a comfortable 6 points over the winning roster.  Virtually all of the top teams in the Milly Maker had one dud in their lineup due to disappointing outputs from low-cost popular plays like Sutton and DJ Moore.   The key to this lineup's sucess was fading the cheap chalk and plugging in a second tight end with upside in the flex spot in O.J. Howard. I typically avoid a two TE lineup, but by rostering Kelce we have the second option on the NFL's best pass offense and with O.J. Howard we have an arguably higher floor and similar ceiling relative to the chalk low $4K WR range.  Duke Johnson stands out as a thin play, but within the context of a Chiefs stack it is more palatable. There were a number of ways to stack the Rams Saints game, but leaving Gurley out proved to be one of the keys to the week for top scoring lineups.

| Position | Player      |  Salary | Pts| Own %|
|----------|-------------|--------:|----:|-----:|
| QB |  Jared Goff    | $6000 | 33.34 | 16.5% |
| RB1 |  Alvin Kamara    | $7300 | 33.6  | 25.81% |
| RB2 |  Duke Johnson | $3800 | 29.6 | 1.8% |
| WR1 |  Michael Thomas | $7600 | 42.1 | 16.63% |
| WR2 |  Brandin Cooks    | $6700 | 26.4 | 11.57% |
| WR3 |  Sammy Watkins    | $4900 | 11.4 | 15.03% |
| TE | Travis Kelce    | $6600 | 28.9 | 17.64% |
| FLEX  | OJ Howard      | $4300 | 21.3 | 20.8% |
| DST |  Miami | $2800 | 25.0 | 7.44% |
|     | Total       | $50000 | 251.64 | |

Looking ahead to week 10 the Bengals Saints game looks to be another potential shootout with major upside for the Bengals passing attack. With no AJ Green I suspect Tyler Boyd will be the most popular WR on the slate. However, WR depth is not one of the Bengal's strengths so Andy Dalton's upside likely will be lowered. Running back pricing is more aggressive with recently popular players like Kareem Hunt now in the mid-$8K range.  Tampa will still be a team I continue to target on both sides of the ball although the Washington offense has not been explosive in 2018.
