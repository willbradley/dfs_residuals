The "Residuals" in DFS Residuals refers to a term used in statistical analysis. Residuals are the difference between the observed value and the estimated value of a quantity of interest in a predictive model.  In daily fantasy we are inherently making predictions each time we create a roster, but often we move on to the next week without thoughtful review of how our predictions aligned with actual outcomes. DFS Residuals aims to provide analysis and insight of DFS outcomes to better inform our decision making making process.
